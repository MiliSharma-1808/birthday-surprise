        <div class="poem-content">
            <p>
                With passion burning in her soul so deep,<br>
                She chases dreams, no climb too steep.<br>
                Through trials, through nights, she never sways,<br>
                Her heart ignites in endless blaze.<br><br>

                She walks with dreams in her eyes so bright,<br>
                Chasing the stars in the quiet night.<br>
                Her voice, a melodyâ€”so soothing, so deep,<br>
                A song so gentle, it makes hearts leap.<br><br>

                Her voice, a melody, soft and sweet,<br>
                A song that makes the world feel complete.<br>
                Like whispers floating in the air,<br>
                A soothing touch beyond compare.<br><br>

                With colors, clips, and frames in sync,<br>
                She crafts emotions, makes us think.<br>
                A storyteller, bold and true,<br>
                Her words paint skies in shades of blue.<br><br>

                Poems, stories, a world she weaves,<br>
                Where magic lingers, where hearts believe.<br>
                Each rhyme, each tale, a masterpiece,<br>
                A touch of art, a breath of peace.<br><br>

                A seeker, learner, mind so wide,<br>
                She dives where endless wonders hide.<br>
                Through pages vast, her dreams take flight,<br>
                To serve, to lead, to spread the light.<br><br>

                A soul so rare, a heart so kind,<br>
                A radiant glow, a brilliant mind.<br>
                With dreams so fierce, with steps so free,<br>
                She is the light the world should see.<br><br>

                ðŸ’– Happiest Birthday, Didu! ðŸ’–<br>
                May your path be filled with endless light,<br>
                May your dreams take their greatest flight.<br>
                You inspire, you shine, you're one of a kind,<br>
                A blessing to hearts, a radiant mind.<br><br>
        </p>
